<h2>My Favorite Albums</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>Selfish Machines (2010)</dt>
	<dd>This is Pierce the Veil's second album and it is my favorite album, this album is about the complexities of love and it's emotional weight.</dd>
	
	<dt>Collide With the Sky (2012)</dt>
	<dd>This is the bands third album, this album includes more serious topics, although it was released in 2012 it has grown in popularity over the past years and pushed for the bands recognition.</dd>
	
	<dt>The Jaws of Life (2023)</dt>
	<dd>This is the bands latest album and the one that I believe to be drastically different from the rest, "the Jaws of Life is a machine that is meant to save people's lives, to pry them out of things", this album deals with lifes difficulties.</dd>
